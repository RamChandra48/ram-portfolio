This is the personal portfolio of Ram Chandra Ramaraju. It's built around a grid of "image tiles" that smoothly transition to secondary landing pages, and includes a number of neat effects, extra features, and all the usual stuff you'd expect. Hope you dig it!

Demo images courtesy of Unsplash, a fantastic collection of CC0 (public domain) images you can use for pretty much whatever.
